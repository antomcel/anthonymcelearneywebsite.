    <br>Now in 2018 ITB boasts so much new equipment compared to when it first opened. There are several mac labs, plenty of lecture rooms with the latest audio and pcs, a sports hall, a gym, a canteen with delicious food an coffee machienes and much more.
 As ITB is about to embark on a new chapter in January 2019, everyone is very excited of the prospect of the college becoming a university.This is a very exciting time for all three colleges, ITB, DIT and ITT, and this gives us a chance to look back on how far the college has come since its opening in 1999 whilst looking forward to the future. This website will commemorate ITBs origins, both as a campsus and a college. The website aims to show ‘ The story of ITB ’ with the focus of the website on the history of the college and its campus. </p>
